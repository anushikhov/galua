		<h1>Networking Introduction</h1>
		<h2>Defining Computer Networking</h2>
		<p>To be considered a network, a collection of elements needs to have connection software, systems, and network elements (such as switches, physical transmission media, and an addressing system).</p>
		<p>Any computer network has the following essential components:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Connected systems</li>
			<li>Connection software</li>
			<li>Networking hardware</li>
			<li>Physical transmission media</li>
			<li>An addressing system for each of the aforementioned components</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Connection software is ubiquitous in all systems that must be networked together.</p>
		<p>The physical transmission medium refers to any medium that can transmit an electromagnetic signal. A signal is a time varying pattern in signal amplitude, voltage, or frequency that represents information in the form of data that can be propagated some distance and recognized by a receiver. Signals can be continuously variable (analog), or they can be discrete and limited to specific states (digital). Systems in use are mostly digital, more specifically binary.</p>
		<p>The transmission of binary signals for the data stream between two systems in a network means not only that the physical media can be wires and cables, but also any part of the electromagnetic spectrum can theoretically be used to transmit data. Phones connect to a network with a radio frequency connection. Cellular networks transmit data across long distances by using microwave transmitters. The 802.11 Wi-Fi standards are radio frequency transmissions. You can get interference from 900 MHz wireless telephone that overlaps with the 802.11b standard, or from a microwave oven that operates at 2.4 GHz and interferes with the 802.11g Wi-Fi standard.</p>
		<p>Broadcast communications would be considered network communications, although there is no specific address to a receiving system. Broadcast communications are essential in most network technologies. Systems send out broadcasts to indicate that they are available to perform a service, or that they exist and can service a request. Broadcast communications are used to identify a system or to browse the network. Implicit in the definition of a broadcast is that ny system that conforms to the requirement meets one of the following conditions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> It is on the same network, or runs the same identification protocol, such as Windows NetBEUI or WINS.</li>
			<li> It has the software installed to accept and manage a data stream and can participate in broadcast communications.</li>
		</ul>
