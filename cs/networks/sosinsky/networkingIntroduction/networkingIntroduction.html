		<h1>Networking Introduction</h1>
		<p>A computer network is a connection or a set of connections made between two or more computers for the purpose of exchanging data.</p>
		<p>To classify networks into different types, consider the number of elements, distribution of objects and connection methods.</p>
		<p>A direct attachment between two computers with a cable is the smallest network.</p>
		<p>Peer-to-peer systems are used where there are a small number of systems that don't require a central service. Some computer buses are configurable and thus are considered small networks, e.g. LANs, pLANs, Bluetooth. USB is not configurable and is therefore not a network.</p>
		<p>A LAN that is separated by a bridging element would be considered a separate LAN.</p>
		<p>When the bridge separates multiple LANs that are geographically dispersed, it is considered a wide area network, WAN.</p>
		<p>Network topologies can be analyzed and categorized in terms of Graph Theory.</p>
		<p>Different topologies offer different capabilities and have different requirements. The processes of mapping a network's topology can be done for physical or logical network elements, or based on how signals propagate through the network.</p>
		<h3>Bus</h3>
		<p>A bus is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. The term covers all related hardware, software components and communication protocols.</p>
		<p>Buses can use both parallel and bit serial connections, and can be wired in either a multidrop or daisy chain topology, or connect with switched hubs, as in the case of USB.</p>
