		<h2>Propositional Logic</h2>
		<p>The rules of logic give precise meaning to mathematical statements.</p>
		<p>A proposition is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both.</p>
		<p>We use letters to denote propositional variables (or statement variables), that is, variables that represent propositions, just as letters are used to denotenumerical variables. The conventional letters used for propositional variables are <i>p, q, r, s,...</i> . The truth value of a proposition is true, denoted by T, if it is a true proposition, and the truth value of a proposition is false, denoted by F, if it is a false proposition.</p>
		<p>The area of logic that deals with propositions is called the propositional calculus or propositional logic.</p>
		<p>Many mathematical statements are constructed by combining one or more propositions. New propositions, called compound propositions, are formed from existing propositions using logical operators.</p>

		<p>DEFINITION 1</p>
		<p><b>Let <i>p</i> be a proposition. The negation of p, denoted by &not;<i>p</i>, is the statement "It is not the case that <i>p</i>." The proposition &not;<i>p</i> is read "not <i>p</i>." The truth value of the negation of <i>p</i>, &not;<i>p</i>, is the opposite of the truth value of p.</b></p>
