        <h2 id="1">Real Numbers</h2>

        <p>We can denote a set via the roster method or the set-builder notation.</p>

        <p>Each time we expand a number system, we do so in order to be able to handle new, and usually more complicated, problems.</p>

        <p>A rational number is a number that can be expressed as a qutient a/b of two integers, where b ≠ 0.</p>
        
        <p>Rational numbers may be represented as decimals.</p>
        
        <p>Every rational number may be represented by a decimal that either terminates or is nonterminating with a repeating block of digits, and vice versa.</p>

        <p>Every irrational number may be represented by a decimal that neither repeats nor terminates.</p>

        <p>Together, the rational numbers and irrational numbers form the set of real numbers.</p>

        <p>Every decimal may be represented by a real number, and every real number may be represented by a decimal.</p>

        <p>Truncation (correct to a given number of decimal places) - drop all the digits that follow the specified final digit in the decimal.</p>

        <p> Rouding - Identify the specified final digit in the deciaml. If the next digit is 5 or more, add 1 to the final digit, otherwite leave the final digit as it is. Then truncate following the final digit.</p>

        <h3>Properties of Real Numbers</h3>

        <p>The four important properties of equality are listed next. b and c represent real numbers.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>The <b>reflexive property</b> states that a number always equals itself; i.e., a = a.</li>
            <li>The <b>symmetric property</b> states that if a = b then b = a.</li>
            <li>The <b>transitive property</b> states that if a = b and b = c then a = c.</li>
            <li>The <b>principle of substitution</b> states that if a = b and b = c then we may substitute b for a in any expression containing a.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Other properties</p>

        <p>The <b>commutative property</b> states that the order in which addition or multiplication takes place will not affect the final result. a + b = b + a</p>

        <p>The <b>associative property</b> states that the way we add or multiply three real numbers will not affect the final result. a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c = a + b + c</p>

        <p>The <b>distributive property</b> states that multiplying the sum of two or more addends by a number will give the same result as multiplying each addend individually by the number and then adding the products together.  a ⋅ (b + c) = a ⋅ b + a ⋅ c     (a + b) ⋅ c = a ⋅ c + b ⋅ c </p>

        <p>The distributive property may be used to remove parentheses or to combine two expressions.</p>

        <p><b>Identity properties:</b> 0 + a = a      1 ⋅ a = a </p>

        <p>We call 0 the <b>additive identity</b> and 1 the <b>multipicative identity.</b></p>

        <p>For each real number a, there is a real number -a, called the <b>additive inverse</b> of a, having the following property.</p>

        <p>The <b>additive inverse property:</b> a + (-a) = 0</p>

        <p>For each nonzero real number a, there is a real number 1/a, called the <b>multiplicative inverse</b> of a, having the following property.</p>

        <p><b>Multiplicatve inverse property:</b> a ⋅ 1/a = 1/a ⋅ a = 1   if a ≠ 0</p>

        <p>The multiplicative inverse 1/a of a nonzero real number a is also referred to as the <b>reciprocal</b> of a.</p>

        <p>The <b>difference</b> a - b is defined as: a - b = a + (-b)</p>

        <p>If b is a nonzero real number, the <b>quotient</b> a/b is defined as: a/b = a ⋅ 1/b   if b ≠ 0</p>

        <p><b>Multiplication by zero:</b> a ⋅ 0 = 0</p>

        <p><b>Division properties:</b> 0/a = 0   a/a = 1   if a ≠ 0</p>

        <p>Division by zero is not defined.</p>

        <p><b><i>"Black holes are where God divided by zero."</i></b></p>

        <p><b>Rules of signs:</b> a(-b) = -(ab)   -(a)b = -(ab)   (-a)(-b) = ab   -(-a) = a   a/(-b) = (-a)/b = -(a/b)   (-a)/(-b) = a/b</p>

        <p><b>Cancellation properties:</b> ac = bc implies a = b if c ≠ 0         ac/bc = a/b   if b ≠ 0, c ≠ 0</p>

        <p><b>Zero-product property:</b> If ab = 0, then a = 0, or b = 0, or both.</p>

        <p>Arithmetic of quoties: a/b + c/d = ad/bd + bc/bd = (ad + bc)/bd   if b ≠ 0, d ≠ 0</p>
        <p>a/b ⋅ c/d = ac/bd if b ≠ 0, d ≠ 0</p>
        <p>(a/b)/(c/d)=a/b ⋅ d/c = ad/bc   if b ≠ 0, c ≠ 0, d ≠ 0</p>

        <p>The LCM (least common multiple) of two numbers is the smallest number that each has as a common multiple.</p>

        <p>Sometimes it is easier to add two fractions using LCM.</p>
