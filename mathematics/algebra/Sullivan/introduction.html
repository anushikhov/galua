        <h2 id="1">Real Numbers</h2>

        <p>We can denote a set via the roster method or the set-builder notation.</p>

        <p>Each time we expand a number system, we do so in order to be able to handle new, and usually more complicated, problems.</p>

        <p>A rational number is a number that can be expressed as a qutient a/b of two integers, where b ≠ 0.</p>
        
        <p>Rational numbers may be represented as decimals.</p>
        
        <p>Every rational number may be represented by a decimal that either terminates or is nonterminating with a repeating block of digits, and vice versa.</p>

        <p>Every irrational number may be represented by a decimal that neither repeats nor terminates.</p>

        <p>Together, the rational numbers and irrational numbers form the set of real numbers.</p>

        <p>Every decimal may be represented by a real number, and every real number may be represented by a decimal.</p>

        <p>Truncation (correct to a given number of decimal places) - drop all the digits that follow the specified final digit in the decimal.</p>

        <p> Rouding - Identify the specified final difit in the deciaml. If the next digit is 5 or more, add 1 to the final digit, otherwite leave the final digit as it is. Then truncate following the final digit.</p>

        <h3>Properties of Real Numbers</h3>

        <p>The four important properties of equality are listed next. b and c represent real numbers.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>The <b>reflexive property</b> states that a number always equals itself; i.e., a = a.</li>
            <li>The <b>symmetric property</b> states taht if a = b then b = a.</li>
            <li>The <b>transitive property</b> states that if a = b and b = c then a = c.</li>
            <li>The <b>principle of substitution</b> states that if a = b and b = c then we may substitute b for a in any expression containing a.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Other properties</p>

        <p>The <b>commutative property</b> states that the order in which addition or multiplication takes place will not affect the final result. a + b = b + a</p>

        <p>The <b>associative property</b> states that the way we add or multiply three real numbers will not affect the final result. a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c = a + b + c</p>

        <p>The <b>distributive property states that multiplying the sum of two or more addends by a number will give the same result as multiplying each addend individually by the number and then adding the products together. </b> a ⋅ (b + c) = a ⋅ b + a ⋅ c     (a + b) ⋅ c = a ⋅ c + b ⋅ c </p>
